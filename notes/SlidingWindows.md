### JavaScript Data Structures & Algorithms
- Algorythmic methods/ approaches to solving leetcode questions


## The Sliding Window Technique
- Try to imagine a rectangle and have it represent some sort of data. This could be a linked list or array or string etc. 
- Best way to imagine this a array of characters/integer values
- Slap a window and start asking questions in this square.
- Goal is to optimize something and just take notes.
- Keep sliding the window down the code and keep taking notes and asking questions.

# Goal of The Sliding Window
- Getting Rid of duplicate work and sliding over linear time (Big-O)

## Example 
- Find the maximum sum of a contiguous subArray of size 3 

- [4,2,1,7,8,1,2,8,1,0]
-  ^
- Sliding window is on 4

- Keep track of the current running sum intialized to 0.

- let run = 0;
