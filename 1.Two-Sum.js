//First LeetCode Practice Question

//Assumptions

//1. Each Input has exactly one solution 
//2. Can't use the same elements twice


//Approach 

//More Examples for understanding

//nums = [1,5,9]
//target = 10





var twoSum = function (nums, target) {
    for(var i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
        
    }       
}
